# A Soliloquy of Marc Antony

Oh pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths to ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and uterrance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd by the hands of war
All pity choked by custom of fell deeds
Then Caesar's Spirit, raging with revenge,
With Ate from his side come hot from hell
Shall in these confines with with a monarch's voice
Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war
